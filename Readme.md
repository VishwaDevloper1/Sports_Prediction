Sports Image Classification using CNN (EfficientNetB0)

Overview:
This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the EfficientNetB0 architecture to classify images into different sports categories. By uploading an image of a sport, the model predicts and returns the sport's name.

Features:
EfficientNetB0 model: A state-of-the-art deep learning model for image classification, known for its efficiency and accuracy.
Flask-based Web Application: Simple web interface to upload images and receive classification results in real time.
Image Processing: Automatically processes and resizes images to suit the modelâ€™s input requirements.
Multiple Sports Categories: Classifies images into a wide variety of sports such as football, basketball, tennis, etc.

Setup and Installation:

1.Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
 cd your-repository

2.Install dependencies:
 python3 -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
 pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Download the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model:
 Ensure the efficientnet_model.h5 file is in the model/ directory, or download it using the script provided.

4.Run the Flask app:
 python app.py

5.Access the web app:
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the application.

How to Use:
1.Upload an image of a sport by clicking the Choose File button on the homepage.
2.Click Upload to submit the image.
3.The app will process the image and display the predicted sport category on the result page.

Model and Training
 Model Architecture: The model is based on EfficientNetB0, which is highly efficient and suitable for lightweight applications.
 Training Data: The model was trained using a dataset containing labeled images from various sports categories.
 Transfer Learning: EfficientNetB0 has been fine-tuned using transfer learning for optimal performance in classifying sports images.

( Note - It works for only below sports Categories if you want to add more categories in it u can add more data to data folder and train the model again by running main.py file
